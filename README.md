# Simple Webshop

This is a simple Webshop created with React.

Following libraries were used:

- for state management: redux + react-redux
- for UI elements: @mui
- for routing: react-router-dom
- for persistance: redux-persist
- for HTTP calls: axios

After cloning the project run `npm install` and then you are ready to go. You could either run the App locally with `npm start` or build the app with `npm run build` and have it ready for deployment.

## More details concerning the scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
